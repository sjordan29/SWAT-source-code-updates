# Source Code Updates

## Modifications to SWAT 
We make updates to the reservoir module of the Soil & Water Assessment Tool by modifying the following files:
* `res.f`
* `modparm.f`
And adding the following file:
* `interp_lin.f`

## Compiling Source Code for Linux
This is a fork of [an existing repo](https://github.com/WatershedModels/SWAT).

Run `compile.sh` to compile the executable with the updated source code.
